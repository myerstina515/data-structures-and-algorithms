# Graphs

> Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

1. AddNode()
Adds a new node to the graph
Takes in the value of that node
Returns the added node
2. AddEdge()
Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
Include the ability to have a “weight”
Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
Both nodes should already be in the Graph
3. GetNodes()
Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
4. GetNeighbors()
Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
Takes in a given node
Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
5. Size()
Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

## Challenge

> Add the following methods to the graph class we began in class: GetNodes(): Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar), Size(): Returns the total number of nodes in the graph, and complete testing

## Approach & Efficiency

> Compared the methods we completed in class to those that we learned about during our reading assignment and came up with the remaining two methods. Testing completed through test #5, then got stuck with a test not passing.

## API

As noted above,
> AddNode(): Adds a new node to the graph, Takes in the value of that node, Returns the added node
> AddEdge(): Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph, Include the ability to have a “weight”, Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge, Both nodes should already be in the Graph
> GetNodes(): Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
> GetNeighbors(): Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node, Takes in a given node, Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
> Size(): Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
